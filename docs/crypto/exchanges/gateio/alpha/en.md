##  Usage Instructions

Before using the Alpha Account API, please ensure:

  1. You have opened an Alpha account
  2. You have obtained the corresponding API permissions
  3. You understand the trading rules and restrictions of Alpha accounts

##  API Categories

  * **Account Query** : Query the asset status of Alpha accounts
  * **Asset Transactions** : Query account asset change records
  * **Quotation Trading** : Get quotes and conduct transactions
  * **Order Management** : Query and manage trading orders
  * **Currency Information** : Query supported currencies and price information

#  Authentication

##  Generate API key

Before calling the private API interface, the API key of the account needs to be generated to verify the identity. You can log in on the website and generate it in [account management] - > [APIv4 keys], or click [ here](/myaccount/apiv4keys) to generate API keys.

Each account can create 20 API keys, and the permission configuration of each key is independent of each other. It is recommended to set a note name for each key to indicate its purpose.

**`Key`** Access Key **`Secret Key`** The key used for signature authentication encryption

Besides, you can attach an IP whitelist, which requires the server only accept requests from specified IPs. Each key can have at most 20 IPs formatted in IPv4(not supporting IP range though). If IP whitelist is not set, the server will skip client IP validation.

Each user can create at most 5 keys with separate permissions. It is recommended to set a name for key denoting how the key will be used.

TIP

Note: If the key is named with `spot` or `futures`, then it could be the default name after APIv4 migration. For details refer to _About APIv4 key improvement_ section

Created key can also be updated or deleted, but any modification(s) can take up to 5 minutes to take effect.

Please note that futures TestNet trading is a separate environment from futures real trading. Real trading API keys cannot be used in TestNet. If you want to test futures API with TestNet, you need to log into the console to generate TestNet API keys(in _"Futures TestNet APIKeys"_ tab on _" APIv4Keys"_ page). Making futures requests are identical between real and TestNet trading, with the only exceptions are different base URLs and different API keys.

##  APIv4 Permissions

When creating a Key, you can configure whether to enable spot, margin, contract, wallet, or withdrawal permissions for the Key, and whether to enable read-write or read-only permissions.

APIv4 PermissionsProducts | Permissions  
---|---  
`spot/margin` | `Read-only` query orders `Read-write` query orders & place orders  
`perpetual contract` | `Read-only` query orders `Read-write` query orders & place orders  
`delivery contract` | `Read-only` query orders `Read-write` query orders & place orders  
`wallet` | `Read-only` Query for withdrawal transfer records `Read-write` Query for account records & fund transfers  
`withdrawal` | `Read-only` Query cash withdrawal records `Read-write` Query cash withdrawal records & withdrawals  
  
All `GET` operations are read requests, while others are write requests. Each permission group can be set to disabled, read-only or read-write.

Please note that even though withdrawal API has only one operation(i.e. `POST /withdrawals`), for general concern, it is still separated from wallet API into a standalone permission group, while withdrawal history retrieving API stays inside wallet operations( i.e., `GET /wallet/withdrawals`).

##  APIv4 signed request requirements

  1. Generate APIv4 Key pairs in web console, and make sure it has the right permissions.
  2. Set request header `KEY` to the key.
  3. Set request header `Timestamp` to current time formatted in Unix time in seconds. Pay attention that the gap between its value and current time cannot exceed 60 seconds.
  4. Set request header `SIGN` to encrypted request signature. Refer to next section for how signature string is generated. Signature generation method is `HexEncode(HMAC_SHA512(secret, signature_string))`, i.e., the hexadecimal digest output of HMAC-SHA512 with APIv4 secret as secret and signature string as message,
  5. Make sure request client's IP is in your APIv4 Key's IP whitelist.

##  API Signature string generation

In APIv4, signature string is concatenated as the following way:

`Request Method + "\n" + Request URL + "\n" + Query String + "\n" + HexEncode(SHA512(Request Payload)) + "\n" + Timestamp`

###  Request Method

Request method in UPPERCASE, e.g. `POST`, `GET`

###  Request URL

Request url. Protocol, host and port are not included, e.g. `/api/v4/futures/orders`

###  Query String

Request query string without URL encode. query parameters order should be the same as how they are concatenated in the request URL, e.g. `status=finished&limit=50`. Use empty string("") if no query parameters.

###  HexEncode(SHA512(Request Payload))

Hash the request body with SHA512 and output its Hex encoded form. If no request body, use empty string's hashed result, i.e. `cf83e1357eefb8bdf1542850d66d8007d620e4050b5715dc83f4a921d36ce9ce47d0d13c5d85f2b0ff8318d2877eec2f63b931bd47417a81a538327af927da3e`

###  Timestamp

`Timestamp` request header value.

Examples

Note: all example signature string are broken into multiple lines for displaying purpose only. Only the `\n` character in signature string is reserved in reality.

Suppose the key we used is `key`, while the secret is `secret`.

  1. List all orders

    
    
    	GET /api/v4/futures/orders?contract=BTC_USD&status=finished&limit=50 HTTP/1.1
    

Signature string：
    
    
    	GET\n
    	/api/v4/futures/orders\n
    	contract=BTC_USD&status=finished&limit=50\n
    	cf83e1357eefb8bdf1542850d66d8007d620e4050b5715dc83f4a921d36ce9ce47d0d13c5d85f2b0ff8318d2877eec2f63b931bd47417a81a538327af927da3e\n
    	1541993715
    

Explanation：

  * `/api/v4/futures/orders`: request url
  * `contract=BTC_USD&status=finished&limit=50`: keep the query string as it is in the request url
  * request body use empty string's hashed result
  * `1541993715`: Unix timestamp in seconds

  2. Create an order

    
    
    	POST /api/v4/futures/orders HTTP/1.1
    
    	{"contract":"BTC_USD","type":"limit","size":100,"price":6800,"time_in_force":"gtc"}
    

Signature string：
    
    
    	POST\n
    	/api/v4/futures/orders\n
    	\n
    	ad3c169203dc3026558f01b4df307641fa1fa361f086b2306658886d5708767b1854797c68d9e62fef2f991645aa82673622ebf417e091d0bd22bafe5d956cca\n
    	1541993715
    

Explanation：

  * request query string is empty, use plain empty string
  * use the hashed result of the json-string-formatted request body

        print(res.status_code)
        print(res.content)
    

##  Error Handling

For all abnormal requests, APIv4 will return non-2xx status code, with a response body in JSON format to explain the error.

The error response body follows a format like:
    
    
    {
      "label": "INVALID_PARAM_VALUE",
      "message": "Invalid parameter `text` with value: abc"
    }
    

  * `label`: denotes error type in `string` format. Its value are chosen from a certain list(see below). Programs can use `label` to identify and catch a specific error.
  * `message`(or `detail`): detailed error message. A longer explanation showing why the error is generated or how to avoid it. Its purpose is helping to better understand the API. Error handling mechanism with this field is highly **NOT** recommended.

Take Python [requests ](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for example, error handling can be written like:

> Following examples only deal with business-related errors. Network timeout or other common errors need to be handled separately:
    
    
    import requests
    
    r = requests.get("https://api.gateio.ws/api/v4/futures/btc/contracts/BTC_USD")
    try:
        r.raise_for_status()
    except requests.HTTPError:
        # catch 2xx errors, parse error message in body, and do something based on `label`
        if r.json()['label'] == 'xxx':
            print(r.json())
    

or with [Python SDK ](https://github.com/gate/gateapi-python):
    
    
    import json
    from gate_api import FuturesApi
    from gate_api.rest import ApiException
    
    api = FuturesApi()
    try:
        api.get_futures_contract(settle='btc', contract="BTC_USD")
    except ApiException as e:  # ApiException wraps whole error information, see implementation for details
        detail = json.loads(e.value.body)
        if detail['label'] == 'xxx':
            print(detail)
