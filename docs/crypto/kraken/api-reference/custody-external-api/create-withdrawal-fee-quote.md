# Create withdrawal fee quote

> Generates a fee quote for a hypothetical withdrawal from the specified vault. Callers supply the asset and amount they intend to withdraw and receive back a `fee_quote_id` along with a set of fee tiers, each describing the fee charged at a given priority level. The returned `fee_quote_id` can then be passed as `fee_quote_id` on a `request_withdrawal` instruction to `POST /v0/insto/custody/tasks` to submit the actual withdrawal. Quotes are advisory and expire after a short window.

**Rate limit:** 200 requests per 30 seconds per IP.
