# Trading Competitions

> Polymarket Perps Trading Competitions

## Timeline

Competitions will run ad hoc, announced a few days ahead of going live - traders
can track upcoming, live and completed competitions on our
[Competitions page](https://polymarket.com/perps/competitions).

## Prizes

Each competition has a different prize pool for a number of traders on the
final leaderboard, announced prior to the competition beginning. Prizes are
credited as pUSD to the winner's Polymarket Perps account within \~1 week of the
competition ending. No claim is needed.

Live rankings appear on the leaderboard in the
[Competitions tab](https://polymarket.com/perps/competitions) of the Polymarket
Perps page. Final rankings are confirmed after a review for rule violations, so
standings can shift if any accounts are disqualified. Only trades made during
the competition window count toward your score.

## Rules & Guidelines

> [accordion] 1. Who can enter
>
> Open to all non-restricted users. No sign-up needed.
>
> * Eligibility follows Polymarket's restricted-persons policy.
> * Any trade on a competition market during the competition window enters you
>   automatically.
> * Only the competition's markets count, and they're announced before the start.
>   If all markets are in scope, new listings count too.

> [accordion] 2. How scoring works
>
> Score = PnL × √Boosted Volume, on competition markets only.
>
> * **Volume:** the notional size of every fill on qualifying positions, including
>   maker and taker fills, closes, and liquidations.
> * **PnL:** realized plus unrealized PnL after fees and funding. Funding received
>   and maker rebates add to PnL. Funding paid and fees subtract from it.
> * **Boosts:** boosted markets multiply your volume for scoring (e.g. 3x). Other
>   markets count at 1x. Boosts never change your PnL.
> * **Negative scores:** negative PnL produces a negative score, and negative
>   scores still rank.

> [accordion] 3. Minimum trade volume to rank
>
> Trade more than the competitions defined minimum notional volume to qualify for
> prizes. This minimum volume will be announced before each competition, and vary
> by competition.
>
> * Only volume on competition markets counts toward the minimum.
> * Boosts count toward your score but not toward the minimum.

> [accordion] 4. Only new positions count
>
> Positions open at the start are excluded, and so is any trade that adds to them.
>
> * Any trade in a market where you hold a pre-competition position adds to that
>   position, so it won't count toward your volume, PnL or the minimum.
> * Close the position fully to start counting trades in that market.
> * If you flip a pre-competition position (e.g. sell past your long into a
>   short), only the new position counts, from that point on.

> [accordion] 5. Timing and payouts
>
> Winners are paid in pUSD to their perps account after a \~5-day review.
>
> * Only trades filled between the start and end time (UTC) count.
> * Open positions are scored at the oracle mark price at the end. Closing them
>   after the end doesn't change your score.
> * **Ties:** higher boosted volume wins, then the earliest first trade.
> * One prize per user per competition. If more than one of your wallets places,
>   only the best-ranked one wins.
> * No KYC or claim needed.

> [accordion] 6. Fair play
>
> Manipulation of any kind disqualifies all associated accounts.
>
> * This covers wash trading, self-trading, and multi-accounting.
> * Polymarket may change, pause, or end the program, adjust scoring, withhold
>   prizes, or disqualify anyone at its discretion.
