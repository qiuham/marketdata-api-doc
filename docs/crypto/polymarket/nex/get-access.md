# Get Access

> Request access, choose a connection and get test funds.

[Submit the access form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScpqt2izLI3YvRiY9Up6kcqzBcIgWmx-Y7GdkXcwiiNOYRz4g/viewform)
with your name, email, team and what you'd like to run on NEX.

Choose a connection:

* **Public access:** list each stable outbound IPv4 address your clients use.
  If you use a NAT gateway, send its public IPs. We allowlist individual `/32`
  addresses.
* **PrivateLink:** send your 12-digit AWS account ID and confirm you can create
  an endpoint in `eu-west-2` (London), AZ ID `euw2-az1`. This is the recommended
  path for the best latency results.

Add a Telegram or Signal contact for a direct chat with the NEX team. If you
know your expected requests per second and WebSocket connection count, include
those too.

## Test Funds

Include your Amoy trading address so we can arrange test pUSD. For a Deposit
Wallet, send the Deposit Wallet address, which can differ from your signer.
If you need help setting one up, tell us in the form.

We'll email your connection instructions and credentials after approval, then
help with account setup, funds and trading approvals. For PrivateLink, we'll
also approve the endpoint you create.
