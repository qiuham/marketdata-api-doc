# Advanced Trade WebSocket Channels

Use heartbeats to keep all subscriptions openMost channels close within 60-90 seconds if no updates are sent. Subscribe to heartbeats to keep all subscriptions open.

The Coinbase Advanced Trade Market Data WebSocket feed provides the following channels:

Channel| Description| Requires Authentication  
---|---|---

Refer to the documentation on [subscribing to a WebSocket channel](/coinbase-app/advanced-trade-apis/websocket/websocket-overview#subscribing).

For the most reliable connection, authenticate with a CDP API key when subscribing to any channel.

Subscribing to “-USDC” based products are only available on the user channel. Other channels will return the same data as the corresponding “-USD” based products. USDT-USDC and EURC-USDC are available on all channels.

## Heartbeats Channel

Subscribe to the `heartbeats` channel to receive heartbeats messages every second. Heartbeats include a `heartbeat_counter` which verifies that no messages were missed.

Subscribing to the heartbeats channel, alongside other channels, ensures that all subscriptions stay open when updates are sparse. This is useful, for example, when fetching market data for illiquid pairs.
    
    
    // Request
    {
      "type": "subscribe",
      "channel": "heartbeats",
      "jwt": "XYZ"
    }
    

A heartbeats message is of the type `heartbeats` as seen below.
    
    
    // Heartbeats Message
    {
      "channel": "heartbeats",
      "client_id": "",
      "timestamp": "2023-06-23T20:31:26.122969572Z",
      "sequence_num": 0,
      "events": [
        {
          "current_time": "2023-06-23 20:31:56.121961769 +0000 UTC m=+91717.525857105",
          "heartbeat_counter": "3049"
        }
      ]
    }
    

## Candles Channel

Subscribe to the `candles` channel to receive candles messages for specific products with updates every second. Candles are grouped into buckets (granularities) of five minutes.
    
    
    // Request
    {
      "type": "subscribe",
      "product_ids": ["ETH-USD"],
      "channel": "candles",
      "jwt": "XYZ"
    }
    

A candles message is of the type `candles` and some of its parameters include:

  * `start` \- string representation of the UNIX timestamp of the candle.
  * `high` and `low` \- highest and lowest prices during the bucket interval.
  * `open` and `close` \- prices of the first and last trade respectively.
  * `volume` \- base amount that has been traded during this interval.
  * `product_id` \- product identifier for this candle

    
    
    // Candles Message
    {
      "channel": "candles",
      "client_id": "",
      "timestamp": "2023-06-09T20:19:35.39625135Z",
      "sequence_num": 0,
      "events": [
        {
          "type": "snapshot",
          "candles": [
            {
              "start": "1688998200",
              "high": "1867.72",
              "low": "1865.63",
              "open": "1867.38",
              "close": "1866.81",
              "volume": "0.20269406",
              "product_id": "ETH-USD"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    

## Market Trades Channel

The `market_trades` channel sends market trades for a specified product on a preset interval. Clients should provide an array of `product_ids` for which they would like status subscriptions.
    
    
    // Request
    {
      "type": "subscribe",
      "product_ids": ["ETH-USD", "BTC-USD"],
      "channel": "market_trades",
      "jwt": "XYZ"
    }
    

A market trades message is of the type `snapshot` or `update`, and contains an array of market trades. Each market trade belongs to a `side`, which refers to the makers side, and can be of type `BUY`, or `SELL`. The channel collects all updates over the last 250 ms and sends them as an `update` — so an `update` can contain one or many trades, depending on the last 250 ms of trading volume.
    
    
    // Market Trades Message
    {
      "channel": "market_trades",
      "client_id": "",
      "timestamp": "2023-02-09T20:19:35.39625135Z",
      "sequence_num": 0,
      "events": [
        {
          "type": "snapshot",
          "trades": [
            {
              "trade_id": "000000000",
              "product_id": "ETH-USD",
              "price": "1260.01",
              "size": "0.3",
              "side": "BUY",
              "time": "2019-08-14T20:42:27.265Z"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    

## Status Channel

The `status` channel sends all products and currencies on a preset interval. Clients should provide an array of `product_ids` for which they would like status subscriptions.

The `status` channel, like most channels, closes within 60-90 seconds when there are no updates. For example, if you listen for `BTC-USD` updates and nothing changes within 60-90 seconds (which is common), the channel closes. To avoid this, subscribe to the heartbeats in addition to your other channels.
    
    
    // Request
    {
      "type": "subscribe",
      "product_ids": ["ETH-USD", "BTC-USD"],
      "channel": "status",
      "jwt": "XYZ"
    }
    
    
    
    // Status Message
    {
      "channel": "status",
      "client_id": "",
      "timestamp": "2023-02-09T20:29:49.753424311Z",
      "sequence_num": 0,
      "events": [
        {
          "type": "snapshot",
          "products": [
            {
              "product_type": "SPOT",
              "id": "BTC-USD",
              "base_currency": "BTC",
              "quote_currency": "USD",
              "base_increment": "0.00000001",
              "quote_increment": "0.01",
              "display_name": "BTC/USD",
              "status": "online",
              "status_message": "",
              "min_market_funds": "1"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    

## Ticker Channel

The `ticker` channel provides real-time price updates every time a match happens. It batches updates in case of cascading matches, greatly reducing bandwidth requirements.
    
    
    // Request
    {
      "type": "subscribe",
      "product_ids": ["ETH-USD", "BTC-USD"],
      "channel": "ticker",
      "jwt": "XYZ"
    }
    
    
    
    // Ticker message
    {
      "channel": "ticker",
      "client_id": "",
      "timestamp": "2023-02-09T20:30:37.167359596Z",
      "sequence_num": 0,
      "events": [
        {
          "type": "snapshot",
          "tickers": [
            {
              "type": "ticker",
              "product_id": "BTC-USD",
              "price": "21932.98",
              "volume_24_h": "16038.28770938",
              "low_24_h": "21835.29",
              "high_24_h": "23011.18",
              "low_52_w": "15460",
              "high_52_w": "48240",
              "price_percent_chg_24_h": "-4.15775596190603",
              "best_bid": "21931.98",
              "best_bid_quantity": "8000.21",
              "best_ask": "21933.98",
              "best_ask_quantity": "8038.07770938"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    

## Ticker Batch Channel

The `ticker_batch` channel provides latest price updates **every 5000 milliseconds** (5 seconds) if there is a change. It has the same JSON message schema as the `ticker` channel, except the `channel` field will have a value of `ticker_batch` and it currently doesn’t provide best bid or best ask fields.
    
    
    // Request
    {
      "type": "subscribe",
      "product_ids": ["ETH-USD", "BTC-USD"],
      "channel": "ticker_batch",
      "jwt": "XYZ"
    }
    

## Level2 Channel

The `level2` channel guarantees delivery of all updates and is the easiest way to keep a snapshot of the order book.
    
    
    // Request
    {
      "type": "subscribe",
      "product_ids": ["ETH-USD", "BTC-USD"],
      "channel": "level2",
      "jwt": "XYZ"
    }
    

Subscribe to the `level2` channel to guarantee that messages are delivered and your order book is in sync.

The level2 channel sends a message with fields, `type` (“snapshot” or “update”), `product_id`, and `updates`. The field `updates` is an array of objects of `{price_level, new_quantity, event_time, side}` to represent the entire order book. The`event_time` property is the time of the event as recorded by our trading engine.

The `new_quantity` property is the updated size at that price level, not a delta. A `new_quantity` of “0” indicates the price level can be removed.
    
    
    // Example:
    {
      "channel": "l2_data",
      "client_id": "",
      "timestamp": "2023-02-09T20:32:50.714964855Z",
      "sequence_num": 0,
      "events": [
        {
          "type": "snapshot",
          "product_id": "BTC-USD",
          "updates": [
            {
              "side": "bid",
              "event_time": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z",
              "price_level": "21921.73",
              "new_quantity": "0.06317902"
            },
            {
              "side": "bid",
              "event_time": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z",
              "price_level": "21921.3",
              "new_quantity": "0.02"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    

## User Channel

The `user` channel sends updates on all of a user’s open orders and current positions, including all subsequent updates of those orders and positions. The `user` channel expects one connection per user:

  * This connection accepts multiple product IDs in a `product_ids` array. If none are provided, the WebSocket subscription is open to all product IDs.
  * To subscribe to new `product_ids`, close your previous connection by unsubscribing and open a new connection with `product_ids` added to the array.

Subscribing to the User channel returns all `OPEN` orders, batched by 50, in the first few messages of the stream. For example, if you have 109 orders, you will get a snapshot containing 50 orders, followed by a patch of 50 orders, followed by a patch of 9 orders. To know when all of your open orders are returned, look for the first message with less than 50 orders.
    
    
    // Request
    {
      "type": "subscribe",
      "channel": "user",
      "product_ids": ["BTC-USD"],
      "jwt": "XYZ"
    }
    
    
    
    // User message
    {
      "channel": "user",
