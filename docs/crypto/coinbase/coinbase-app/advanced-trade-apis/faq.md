# Advanced Trade API FAQ

### What is Advanced Trade API?

[Advanced Trade REST API](/coinbase-app/advanced-trade-apis/rest-api) supports trading and order management, plus a [WebSocket protocol](/coinbase-app/advanced-trade-apis/websocket/websocket-overview) for real-time market data.

### What is Advanced Trade on Coinbase?

  * Real-time order books and live trade history backed by a simple order process.

### What has happened to Coinbase Pro?

Coinbase Pro has been disabled for use and all customers have been migrated as of December 1, 2023. This was accelerated from a prior announcement of Pro deprecation in 2024. Unauthenticated Pro APIs are still available for customers with access, and the Exchange APIs (FIX, REST WebSocket) continue to be available to Exchange (Institutional) clients.

### Can I use my existing Coinbase Pro API keys to access Advanced Trade?

No, you cannot use existing Pro API keys to trade with Advanced Trade.

### How do I migrate from Pro APIs to Advanced Trade API?

If you are a developer, you must regenerate your API key and adjust your code implementation. If you are using a third party bot, you must regenerate your API keys and update them in the trading bot.

### What are the differences between Advanced Trade and Coinbase Exchange?

### Can I continue to access the FIX API?

Due to low use among retail users, the FIX API is not supported on Coinbase Advanced Trade.

### Why am I receiving an `UNKNOWN_FAILURE_REASON` when placing an order?

When you place an order and receive a response indicating `"success": true` along with `"failure_reason": "UNKNOWN_FAILURE_REASON"`, it means that your order was successfully accepted despite the confusing failure reason message. The `"failure_reason"` field can be ignored in this context as the success status confirms that the order was processed correctly. Here is an example of a successful order placement with an `UNKNOWN_FAILURE_REASON`:
    
    
    {
      "success": true,
      "failure_reason": "UNKNOWN_FAILURE_REASON",
      "order_id": "62475e97-7485-45eb-a5ac-594805fa2748",
      "success_response": {
        "order_id": "62475e97-7485-45eb-a5ac-594805fa2748",
        "product_id": "BTC-USD",
        "side": "BUY",
        "client_order_id": "12345678"
      },
      "order_configuration": {
        "market_market_ioc": {
          "quote_size": "1.0"
        }
      }
    }
    

In this example, the `"success":` true confirms that the order was placed successfully. The `"UNKNOWN_FAILURE_REASON"` does not indicate an issue with the order itself and can be disregarded.

### Why am I receiving an `UNKNOWN` value within the `warning` key in a response and what does it mean?

`UNKNOWN` is the default response for the `warning` key within responses and can therefore be seen as **no warning** being returned.

### Why am I receiving `PREVIEW_INVALID_BASE_SIZE_TOO_SMALL` on my perpetual order?

All perpetual orders are subject to a 10 USDC min notional value.

### What is the difference between my Advanced Trade accounts and my Coinbase App accounts?

Advanced Trade accounts and Coinbase App accounts are tied to the same balances, but Advanced Trade include futures, perpetuals, and margin accounts whereas Coinbase App does not.

### Why am I receiving an `Unsupported account in this conversion` when using the Advanced Trade Converts Endpoints?

Currently the converts endpoints only supports USD `<->` USDC, USD `<->` PYUSD, and EUR `<->` EURC conversions
