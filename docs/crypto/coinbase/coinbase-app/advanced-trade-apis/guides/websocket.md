With this foundational knowledge, you’ll be prepared to integrate the WebSocket API seamlessly into your application.

You can quickly scroll to any section of this article by using the links on the outline of this guide on the right-hand side of the page.

### Overview of WebSocket Functionality

The Coinbase Developer Platform’s Advanced Trade product provides two WebSocket endpoints:

  * **Market Data Endpoint** : `wss://advanced-trade-ws.coinbase.com` This public WebSocket feed delivers real-time updates on market orders and trades for various cryptocurrency products.
  * **User Order Data Endpoint** : `wss://advanced-trade-ws-user.coinbase.com` This authenticated WebSocket feed provides real-time updates on the user’s orders, including order status and updates on active trades.

Both endpoints provide live data streams using WebSocket connections, enabling developers to receive real-time updates on trading activity, order books, and market movements. This guide will cover how to correctly establish these WebSocket connections, manage subscriptions, and handle potential errors during integration.

## 2. Setting Up WebSocket Connections

To integrate with the Coinbase Advanced Trade WebSockets, developers need to establish a WebSocket connection with either the Market Data or User Order Data endpoints. This section will guide you through the process of setting up these WebSocket connections and ensuring they remain active.

### WebSocket Endpoints

**Market Data Endpoint** : `wss://advanced-trade-ws.coinbase.com` This endpoint provides real-time market data, including updates on orders, trades, and price changes for various cryptocurrency pairs. Authentication is not required for most channels on this endpoint. **User Order Data Endpoint** : `wss://advanced-trade-ws-user.coinbase.com` This endpoint provides updates related to a user’s orders, including order status, fills, and real-time changes. It requires authentication using a JWT (JSON Web Token).

### Basic Connection Setup

After establishing a WebSocket connection, the server expects a subscription message to be sent within 5 seconds; otherwise, the connection will be terminated. This subscription message tells the WebSocket server which channels and products the client wants to receive data for. Developers can subscribe to multiple channels, but each subscription must be sent in a unique message.

### Example: Connecting Without Authentication (Market Data Endpoint)

For public data, you can set up a basic WebSocket connection without authentication. Here is an example in Python that connects to the market data WebSocket and subscribes to the `ticker` channel for the BTC-USD product. First, let’s install the necessary dependency:: `pip install websocket`
    
    
    import websocket
    import json
    
    # Market Data WebSocket URL
    WS_URL = "wss://advanced-trade-ws.coinbase.com"
    
    def on_open(ws):
        # Subscribe to the ticker channel for BTC-USD
        subscribe_message = {
            "type": "subscribe",
            "product_ids": ["BTC-USD"],
            "channel": "ticker"
        }
        ws.send(json.dumps(subscribe_message))
        print("Subscribed to BTC-USD ticker channel")
    
    def on_message(ws, message):
        data = json.loads(message)
        print(f"Received message: {data}")
    
    def on_error(ws, error):
        print(f"Error: {error}")
    
    def on_close(ws):
        print("Connection closed")
    
    # Create the WebSocket connection
    ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(
        WS_URL,
        on_open=on_open,
        on_message=on_message,
        on_error=on_error,
        on_close=on_close
    )
    ws.run_forever()
    

In this example, once the connection is established, the client sends a subscription message to the `ticker` channel for the BTC-USD product. The WebSocket then begins streaming real-time price updates for that product.

### Example: Connecting With Authentication (User Order Data Endpoint)

For user-specific data, such as order updates, you must authenticate using a JWT. Below is an example in Python that connects to the User Order Data WebSocket and subscribes to the `user` channel. First, let’s install the necessary dependencies:
    
    
    pip install websocket "pyjwt[crypto]"
    
    
    import websocket
    import json
    import jwt  # PyJWT library
    import time
    import uuid
    
    # User Order Data WebSocket URL
    WS_USER_URL = "wss://advanced-trade-ws-user.coinbase.com"
    
    # Example JWT generation (Replace with your actual API_KEY and SIGNING_KEY)
    API_KEY = "organizations/{org_id}/apiKeys/{key_id}"
    SIGNING_KEY = "-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----\nYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE\n-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
    
    def generate_jwt():
        current_time = int(time.time())
        payload = {
            "iss": "cdp",
            "nbf": current_time,
            "exp": current_time + 120,  # JWT valid for 120 seconds
            "sub": API_KEY,
        }
        headers = {
            "kid": API_KEY,
            "nonce": uuid.uuid4().hex
        }
        return jwt.encode(payload, SIGNING_KEY, algorithm="ES256", headers=headers)
    
    def on_open(ws):
        # Generate JWT
        token = generate_jwt()
    
        # Subscribe to the user channel for BTC-USD orders
        subscribe_message = {
            "type": "subscribe",
            "channel": "user",
            "product_ids": ["BTC-USD"],
            "jwt": token
        }
        ws.send(json.dumps(subscribe_message))
        print("Subscribed to user channel for BTC-USD orders")
    
    def on_message(ws, message):
        data = json.loads(message)
        print(f"Received message: {data}")
    
    def on_error(ws, error):
        print(f"Error: {error}")
    
    def on_close(ws):
        print("Connection closed")
    
    # Create the WebSocket connection
    ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(
        WS_USER_URL,
        on_open=on_open,
        on_message=on_message,
        on_error=on_error,
        on_close=on_close
    )
    
    ws.run_forever()
    

In this authenticated example, we generate a JWT using the PyJWT library and include it in the subscription message for the user channel. This allows the client to receive real-time updates related to the user’s orders for the BTC-USD product.

## 3. Authentication and Subscriptions

WebSocket connections that interact with user-specific data on the Coinbase Developer Platform’s Advanced Trade product require authentication via JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). This section will guide developers through generating JWTs, subscribing to channels, and managing multiple subscriptions effectively.

### Generating and Using JWT Tokens

To subscribe to user-specific channels, such as the `user` or `futures_balance_summary` channels, you must include a valid JWT in the subscription message. The JWT is generated using your API key and signing key.

### Steps to Generate a JWT Token:

  * Obtain your API key and signing key from the Coinbase Developer Platform.
  * Use the JWT to authenticate when subscribing to user-related data channels.
  * JWT tokens expire after 2 minutes, so they must be refreshed regularly.

### Example: Generating a JWT in Python

First, ensure you have the required dependencies installed: `pip install websocket-client PyJWT cryptography` Then, generate the JWT for authentication:
    
    
    import jwt  # PyJWT library
    import time
    import uuid
    
    # Example API and Signing Keys (replace with actual values)
    API_KEY = "organizations/{org_id}/apiKeys/{key_id}"
    SIGNING_KEY = "-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----\nYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE\n-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
    
    def generate_jwt():
        current_time = int(time.time())
        payload = {
            "iss": "cdp",
            "nbf": current_time,
            "exp": current_time + 120,  # valid for 120 seconds
            "sub": API_KEY,
        }
        headers = {
            "kid": API_KEY,
            "nonce": uuid.uuid4().hex
        }
        token = jwt.encode(payload, SIGNING_KEY, algorithm="ES256", headers=headers)
        return token
    
    # Example JWT
    token = generate_jwt()
    print(f"Generated JWT: {token}")
    

This JWT must be included in all subscription messages for user-specific channels.

### Subscribing to Channels

To receive data from WebSocket channels, you need to send a subscription message after establishing the WebSocket connection. Each channel subscription must specify the product IDs (e.g., BTC-USD, ETH-USD) and, if required, a JWT for authentication.

### Example Subscription Message (Authenticated User Channel)

Here’s how to subscribe to the `user` channel for receiving updates on your orders:
    
    
    subscribe_message = {
        "type": "subscribe",
        "channel": "user",
        "product_ids": ["BTC-USD"],
        "jwt": generate_jwt()
    }
    

### Example Subscription Message (Market Data Channel)

For public market data, no JWT is required:
    
    
    subscribe_message = {
        "type": "subscribe",
        "product_ids": ["BTC-USD", "ETH-USD"],
        "channel": "ticker"
    }
    

### Channel Overview

Coinbase Advanced Trade WebSockets provide access to multiple channels, each serving different purposes. Below is an overview of the available channels:

Channel| Description| Authentication Required  
---|---|---  
ticker| Real-time price updates every time a match happens| No  
ticker_batch| Real-time price updates every 5000 milliseconds| No  
market_trades| Real-time updates every time a market trade happens| No  
status| Sends all products and currencies on a preset interval| No  
level2| All updates and easiest way to keep order book snapshot| No  
candles| Price updates aggregated into time intervals| No  
user| Only sends messages that include the authenticated user| Yes  
heartbeats| Real-time server pings to keep all connections open| No  
futures_balance_summary| Real-time updates every time a user’s futures balance changes| Yes  
  
Each subscription can handle only one channel at a time, so if you want to receive data from multiple channels, send a separate subscription message for each.

### Best Practices for Subscriptions

  1. **Load Balancing Across WebSocket Connections** When subscribing to multiple channels or products, it is recommended to spread the load across different WebSocket connections. For example, instead of subscribing to multiple high-volume products (like BTC-USD and ETH-USD) on the same connection, open separate WebSocket connections for each. This reduces the risk of dropped messages and helps distribute inbound traffic more efficiently.
  2. **Using the Heartbeats Channel** The `heartbeats` channel sends periodic heartbeat messages to ensure the WebSocket connection remains active, especially when there are no frequent updates in other channels (e.g., illiquid markets). It is a best practice to subscribe to the `heartbeats` channel alongside other channels to prevent connections from closing due to inactivity.

### Example Heartbeats Subscription:
    
    
    subscribe_message = {
        "type": "subscribe",
        "channel": "heartbeats"
    }
    

Including the heartbeats subscription ensures that the WebSocket connection stays open, even when there is a lack of updates on other subscribed channels.

## 4. WebSocket Channels Overview

Coinbase’s Advanced Trade WebSockets offer various channels that provide real-time market data and user-specific information. This section gives an overview of the available channels, indicates which channels require authentication, and provides sample code to subscribe and unsubscribe from these channels.

### Which Channels Require Authentication?

  * Public Channels (No Authentication Required): These channels are used to receive market data and do not require authentication. They include:
    * level2
    * ticker
    * ticker_batch
    * candles
    * heartbeats
    * market_trades
    * status
  * Private Channels (JWT Authentication Required): These channels provide user-specific data and require the inclusion of a valid JWT token in the subscription message. They include:
    * user
    * futures_balance_summary

### Sample Code for Subscriptions

Below are examples of how to subscribe to and unsubscribe from various channels using Python. These examples demonstrate both public and private channels.

### Subscribing to a Public Channel (e.g., Ticker Channel)

Public channels do not require authentication, so you can simply send a subscription message after establishing the WebSocket connection.
    
    
    import websocket
    import json
    
    def on_open(ws):
        # Subscribe to the ticker channel for BTC-USD
        subscribe_message = {
            "type": "subscribe",
            "product_ids": ["BTC-USD"],
            "channel": "ticker"
        }
        ws.send(json.dumps(subscribe_message))
        print("Subscribed to BTC-USD ticker channel")
    
    # Set up WebSocket connection
    ws = websocket.WebSocketApp("wss://advanced-trade-ws.coinbase.com", on_open=on_open)
    ws.run_forever()
    

### Subscribing to a Private Channel (e.g., User Channel)

Private channels require a JWT for authentication. Use the following code to subscribe to the `user` channel:
    
    
    import websocket
    import json
    
    def on_open(ws):
        jwt_token = generate_jwt()  # Replace with your JWT generation logic
    
        # Subscribe to the user channel
        subscribe_message = {
            "type": "subscribe",
            "channel": "user",
            "product_ids": ["BTC-USD"],
            "jwt": jwt_token
        }
        ws.send(json.dumps(subscribe_message))
        print("Subscribed to user channel for BTC-USD")
    
    # Set up WebSocket connection
    ws = websocket.WebSocketApp("wss://advanced-trade-ws-user.coinbase.com", on_open=on_open)
    ws.run_forever()
    

### Unsubscribing from a Channel

To unsubscribe from a channel, send a message similar to the subscription message but with “type”: “unsubscribe”. You can unsubscribe from either public or private channels using this format. Example: Unsubscribing from the Ticker Channel
    
    
    def unsubscribe(ws):
        unsubscribe_message = {
            "type": "unsubscribe",
            "product_ids": ["BTC-USD"],
            "channel": "ticker"
        }
        ws.send(json.dumps(unsubscribe_message))
        print("Unsubscribed from BTC-USD ticker channel")
    

### Example in JavaScript for Subscribing to a Channel

If developers are using JavaScript, they can use the ws library in a Node.js environment to subscribe to a WebSocket channel. Here’s how to subscribe to the ticker channel:
    
    
    const WebSocket = require('ws');
    
    const ws = new WebSocket('wss://advanced-trade-ws.coinbase.com');
    
    ws.on('open', function open() {
      const subscribeMessage = JSON.stringify({
        type: "subscribe",
        product_ids: ["BTC-USD"],
        channel: "ticker"
      });
      
      ws.send(subscribeMessage);
      console.log("Subscribed to BTC-USD ticker channel");
    });
    
    ws.on('message', function incoming(data) {
      console.log(`Received: ${data}`);
    });
    

## 5. Conclusion

Successfully integrating with Coinbase’s Advanced Trade WebSocket API begins with a solid understanding of connection setup, authentication, and subscription management. Below is a summary of the essential best practices covered in this guide:
