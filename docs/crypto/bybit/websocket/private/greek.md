> [positionIdx](/docs/v5/enum#positionidx)| integer| Used to identify positions in different position modes  
> positionValue| string| Position value  
> riskId| integer| Risk tier ID  
 _for portfolio margin mode, this field returns 0, which means risk limit rules are invalid_  
> riskLimitValue| string| Risk limit value, become meaningless when auto risk-limit tier is applied  
 _for portfolio margin mode, this field returns 0, which means risk limit rules are invalid_  
> entryPrice| string| Average entry price 

  * For USDC Perp & Futures, it indicates average entry price, and it will not be changed with 8-hour session settlement

  
> markPrice| string| Mark price  
> leverage| string| Position leverage  
 _for portfolio margin mode, this field returns "", which means leverage rules are invalid_  
> breakEvenPrice| string| Break even price, only for `linear`,`inverse`. 

  * breakeven_price = (entry_price _qty - realized_pnl) / (qty - abs(qty)_ max(taker fee rate, 0.00055))

  
> autoAddMargin| integer| Whether to add margin automatically when using isolated margin mode 

  * `0`: false

> positionIM| string| Initial margin, the same value as `positionIMByMp`, please note this change [The New Margin Calculation: Adjustments and Implications](https://www.bybit.com/en/help-center/article/Understanding-the-Adjustment-and-Impact-of-the-New-Margin-Calculation)

  * Portfolio margin mode: returns ""

  
> positionMM| string| Maintenance margin, the same value as `positionMMByMp`

  * Portfolio margin mode: returns ""

  
> liqPrice| string| Position liquidation price 

  * Isolated margin:   
it is the real price for isolated and cross positions, and keeps `""` when liqPrice <= minPrice or liqPrice >= maxPrice
  * Cross margin:  
it is an **estimated** price for cross positions(because the unified mode controls the risk rate according to the account), and keeps `""` when liqPrice <= minPrice or liqPrice >= maxPrice

 _this field is empty for Portfolio Margin Mode, and no liquidation price will be provided_  
> takeProfit| string| Take profit price  
> stopLoss| string| Stop loss price  
> trailingStop| string| Trailing stop

> delta| string| Delta. It is only pushed when you subscribe to the option position.  
> gamma| string| Gamma. It is only pushed when you subscribe to the option position.  
> vega| string| Vega. It is only pushed when you subscribe to the option position.  
> theta| string| Theta. It is only pushed when you subscribe to the option position.  
> netDeltaRatio| string| Net delta ratio. Option delta is excluded from the calculation. Calculation: `coinAccountSize = abs(longSize + shortSize)`, `coinBaseSize = max(longSize, abs(shortSize))`, `netDeltaRatio = coinAccountSize / coinBaseSize`. Returns `""` if delta neutral mode is not enabled. Call [POST /v5/account/set-delta-mode](/docs/v5/account/set-delta-mode) to enable delta neutral mode.

> isReduceOnly| boolean| Useful when Bybit lower the risk limit 

  * `true`: Only allowed to reduce the position. You can consider a series of measures, e.g., lower the risk limit, decrease leverage or reduce the position, add margin, or cancel orders, after these operations, you can call [confirm new risk limit](/docs/v5/position/confirm-mmr) endpoint to check if your position can be removed the reduceOnly mark

  * Returns `"-1"` if the symbol has never been traded
  * Returns the seq updated by the last transaction when there are setting like leverage, risk limit

  
> mmrSysUpdatedTime| string| Useful when Bybit lower the risk limit

When isReduceOnly=`false`: the timestamp when the leverage had been adjusted by system
    * It returns the timestamp when the system operates, and if you manually operate, there is no timestamp
    * Keeps `""` by default, if there was a lower risk limit system adjustment previously, it shows that system operation timestamp
    * Only meaningful for isolated margin & cross margin of USDT Perp, USDC Perp, USDC Futures, Inverse Perp and Inverse Futures, meaningless for others

  
> positionIMByMp| string| Initial margin calculated by mark price, the same value as `positionIM`
